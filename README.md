# GTAVCNNProject
Goal: Use deep learning related algorithms to autonomously drive a car in GTA V environment in real time
Questions:
1. whether should we solve it using end-to-end driving or other techniques?
2. where are the resources for sending command to GTA V using deep learning in Windows?
3. how to collect datasets in GTA V?
